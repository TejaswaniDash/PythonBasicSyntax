#booleans always have only 2 possible outcomes or possibilities example- 0 or 1; Yes or No; True or False

a= True
b=False
print (a)
print(b)
print('**************')
print(bool(0))   #here bool is built in available in python
#bool function here returns the value  of something which is true or false
print(bool(1))
print(bool(2)) # here we can see boo(1) and bool(2) is true that means number 0 in any form if we find the
#boolen of that it will be false
#everything else is true

c=""
#empty string
print(bool(c)) #it's false because it is a empty string
c='some value'
print(bool(c)) #it's true as the string is not empty
#boolean is the simplest data type as it have only 2 possibilities
